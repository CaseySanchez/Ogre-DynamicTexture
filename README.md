The "Dynamic Texture" is a readily-programmable method of manipulating textures on the GPU through C++ AMP. It's for those occasions where shaders aren't enough or are too restrictive.

The following examples are of the "CircleKernel" and "BleedKernel", first creating some circles and then causing the image to bleed as though it were a fresh water color painting.
